<!--Introduction -->
# Hey there!
I'm Jairo! I'm currently studying / absolving an apprenticeship as an **Computer Scientist Platform Dev in Switzerland**. I'm passionate about making **open-source** more accessible, creating scripts:computer: and tools to help people. Do :star2: my repository if you find my project interesting, at least your star could make someone's day:pray:.

### üíº  Things that I'm currently working on: 
* Learning PowerShell, Python and Golang :computer:
* Learning about different OS (Windows, MacOS, Linux Distros like Arch, Ubuntu, RHEL, NixOS).
* Looking forward to learn more about Cloud and Networking.

### üå± Challenges that I‚Äôm currently challenging myself:
Since I don't have alot of time because of my apprenticeship and sports (calisthenics, padel) I usually take 1h a day to learn anything that I like to learn at the moment. I'm really interested in Linux, PowerShell, Python, Cloud, Home Lab, Networking etc. I set a couple of self-challenges in order to push myself more further.üèÉ

* Learn to code:man_technologist: 3 days a week with no distraction
* Reading books and listening to podcasts
* Calisthenics  3 times in a week
* Pursuing a CCNA course to achieve the CCNA Certification aswell as the knowledge
* Adapting and Improving my life style (Becoming more productive)
