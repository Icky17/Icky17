<!--Introduction -->
I'm Jairo! I'm currently studying / absolving an apprenticeship as an **Computer Scientist Platform Dev in Switzerland**. I'm passionate about making **open-source** more accessible, creating scripts:computer: and tools to help people. Do :star2: my repository if you find my project interesting, at least your star could make someone's day:pray:.

### 💼  Things that I'm currently working on: 
* Learning PowerShell and Python:computer:
* Learning about different OS (Windows, MacOS, Linux Distros like Arch or Ubuntu).
* Looking forward to learn more about CyberSecurity.

### 🌱 Challenges that I’m currently challenging myself:
Since I don't have alot of time because of my apprenticeship a sports (basketball) I usually take 1h - 2h a day to learn anything that I like to learn at the moment. I'm really interested in Linux, PowerShell, Python, CyberSecurity, Home Lab etc. I set a couple of self-challenges in order to push myself more further.🏃

* Learn to code:man_technologist: 1-2 hours a day with no distraction ( One or two day off a week. ) 
* Read:newspaper: News about new Technology and IT
* Basketball Practice 🏀 3 times in a week
* Adapting and Improving my life style
